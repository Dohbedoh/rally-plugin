This is a Jenkins Plug-in which 
1> pull SCM ChangeSet information from Jenkins Build and updates relevant rally defect or story as a postbuild action

2> picks up Task details [status, actual hrs, todo hrs etc] from scm comments (if provided) and updates rally task details accordingly

3> This plugin saves efforts of writing check-in hooks for svn, cvs, perforce etc which is difficult if organisation uses more than one config management tool
